<p>In this comprehensive data science and machine learning project, I developed a model to predict house prices in Bangalore After fine-tuning the hyperparameters and conducting cross-validation, I discovered that Linear Regression was the most effective approach. The model achieved an impressive 86% accuracy in predicting prices. I utilized the Bangalore prices dataset sourced from Kaggle for this analysis.</p>
